# Wireshark

## Objective
In the given scenario I was tasked as a security analyst to investigate traffic to a website. I analyzed a network packet capture file containing traffic data about users connecting to an interal site.  I had to filter through data to identify the source and destination IP addresses involed in the web browser session, examine which protocols were being used in making a connection to the site, and analyze data packets to identify what types of information were sent and received by the systems that were connected when the packets were captured. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of using Wireshark to inspect activity on a network
- Proficiency in analyzing different data packets and their source and destination IP addresses
- Ability to filter through packets based on their IP address, MAC address, communication protocol, or port number 
- Enhanced knowledge of hig-level packet data like the DNS that was queried, time to live, and frame length

### Tools Used

- Utilized virtualization software VMware 
- Kali linux installed on Vmware
- Wireshark installed on kali linux
